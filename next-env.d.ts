// Fix: Removed problematic type references that cause "Cannot find type definition file" errors.
// Standard Next.js types are already available in this project through module imports.

// NOTE: This file is normally managed by Next.js, but manual adjustments were made to resolve 
// environment-specific compiler errors related to type definition discovery.
// see https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/typescript for more information.
